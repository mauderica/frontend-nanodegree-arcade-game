## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Note: The above game description and rules were taken from the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Frogger Game description.

## Special Features (Upcoming)

Future additional functionality:
* Player selection --> allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game.
* Score board --> implement a score for the game, to be shown on a score board, where the score increases each time the player reaches the water, and is reduced when collision occurs.
* Timer --> when the player begins the game, a count-down timer is started. Once the time is elapsed, the game stops and the final score is posted to the scoreboard and shown to the user in a modal, with an option to play again.
* Difficulty setting --> allow the user to select the difficulty level before starting the game.
